US Code Title 17 - Copyright Law
"Copyright protection subsists explicitly in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression. This includes literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works. The owner of copyright has the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, and distribute copies."

State Contract Law - General Principles
"A legally binding contract requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Consideration is the exchange of something of value between the parties. Contracts can be written or oral, but certain types (like real estate sales) must be in writing to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds."
